# Wedding App

This project was created for my third Milestone Project with Code Institute in order to display my knowledge and understanding 
of HTML, CSS, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

This project is definitely the one I am most excited about creating because it is for my sister for her wedding. She asked me a couple 
of months ago to make her a site where her wedding guests could RSVP, register, log in and see all of the information they need to know 
about her big day as well as allowing them to submit any dietary requirements or accessibility issues. This site will allow her to relax 
in the leadup to her big day knowing that all the guests data will be stored in the one place for her to view rather than sending multiple 
emails to find out the information.

This is my first project where I will be getting instructions from my sister on the features and content needed on this site and I think it 
will be a great learning curve for what I can expect when I start working as a Web Developer.
